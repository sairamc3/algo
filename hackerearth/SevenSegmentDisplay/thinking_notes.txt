To solve this problem:

	1. Find the no of match sticks are used to get the given number
		- Since each number has specified amount of sticks required, it is not hard to find out.
		- We can create a hashmap to store that information
			0 -> 6
			1 -> 2
			2 -> 5
			3 -> 5
			4 -> 4
			5 -> 5
			6 -> 6
			7 -> 3
			8 -> 7
			9 -> 6
	2. How to find the max number using the same or less no of sticks
		- We should get more numbers with the count ( so that if we get 3 numbers then the numbers will be in hundreds)
		- Next priority would be order the max number to the left side
	
	Example:

		if the sample is given as 6, then the no of sticks she has is 6.
		now with 6 sticks, calculate the max number
		
		it looks like we need not think about all the numbers.

		We can use only 2 and 3 match sticks to form a number

			-> which would be '1' and '7'
		So in this case, we can divide the number by 2 and result would be no of one's
		if the number is odd then we can modify the left most number with 3.
		
		Let's try that...
