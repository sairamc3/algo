given:

Two arrays of same size and same elements, but the order of the elements is different.
We need to make sure that by modifying the min subset of the array to make the two arrays equal. 

Example:
	A -> {1,1,2,1}
	B -> {2,1,1,1}

So, here last element is the same hence need to sort the last one. So we need to sort from index 0 to 2. Hence the length of the sub array would be 3.

We should implement this logic in coding. 

	- to make things simple, we need to find the common ones from the begining of the array and the ending of the array. 
	- then the subarray in the middle will be become the subarray that need to be sorted. 

	Caution: Please be careful about the edge cases.
