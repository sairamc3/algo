You are given an array A of N elements. Now you need to choose the best index of this array . An index of the array is called best if the special sum of this index is maximum across the special sum of all the other indices.

To calculate the special sum for any index  , you pick the first element that is and add it to your sum. Now you pick next two elements i.e.  and and add both of them to your sum. Now you will pick the next  elements and this continues till the index for which it is possible to pick the elements. For example:
