Best index:

How to find best index in an array.

Consider having an array of size 10.

Best index is the index having special sum.

	Special Sum: 
		Special sum of index 3 is ->
		
		A[3]+(A[4]+A[5])+(A[6]+A[7]+A[8])

		The sum stops at index 8, since the next 4 indexes are not available.

Brute Force approach:

	- Calculate the Special sum of every element in the array
		* Find the difference between last index and the choosen index
		* That particular number should match the sequnce 1+2+3+....+n
			> the toughest part of the problem is here
		* to find the sum of the above series until the nth element, the forumla would be
			> n*(n+1)/2 
		* if we try to solve the above problem with this solution
			> total elements is 10, i.e the index will be until 9
			> choosen index is 3
			> hence 9-3 = 6
			> so the no of elements that we can add should be less than 6
			> according to above formula
				- n*(n+1)/2 <= 6
			> in this case it would be 3 -> 3*4/2 = 6
			> so we add from A[3]...A[8]
	- In that choose the max number
